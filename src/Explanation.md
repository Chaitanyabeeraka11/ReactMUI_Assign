1. Initial Render:

When the MovieList component first renders:

```javascript
const MovieList = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { popularMovies, status, error } = useSelector((state) => state.movies);

  // ... rest of the component
};
```

- `useDispatch` hook: This hook connects to the Redux store and returns the `dispatch` function. It doesn't cause any re-renders.

- `useSelector` hook: This hook runs and selects the current state from the Redux store. Initially, it might look like:
  ```javascript
  {
    popularMovies: [],
    status: 'idle',
    error: null
  }
  ```

2. useEffect Hook:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (status === "idle") {
    dispatch(getPopularMovies());
  }
}, [status, dispatch]);
```

- This hook runs after the initial render.
- It sees that `status` is 'idle', so it dispatches the `getPopularMovies` action.

3. Redux Thunk Middleware:

- The `getPopularMovies` thunk is executed.
- It immediately dispatches a pending action: `getPopularMovies.pending`

4. Redux Reducer:

- The pending action is handled in the moviesSlice:
  ```javascript
  .addCase(getPopularMovies.pending, (state) => {
    state.status = 'loading';
  })
  ```
- The state is updated: `status` changes from 'idle' to 'loading'.

5. React Re-render:

- The `useSelector` hook detects this state change and causes a re-render of MovieList.
- This time, when the component renders, it hits this condition:
  ```javascript
  if (status === "loading") {
    return <CircularProgress />;
  }
  ```
- A loading spinner is displayed to the user.

6. API Call Completes:

- The thunk's API call completes, returning data for two movies.
- The thunk dispatches a fulfilled action: `getPopularMovies.fulfilled`, with the movie data as payload.

7. Redux Reducer Again:

- The fulfilled action is handled:
  ```javascript
  .addCase(getPopularMovies.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
    state.status = 'succeeded';
    state.popularMovies = action.payload;
  })
  ```
- The state is updated: `status` becomes 'succeeded', and `popularMovies` is set to the array of two movies.

8. Another React Re-render:

- `useSelector` detects this state change and triggers another re-render.
- This time, the component skips the loading and error conditions and renders the movie grid:
  ```javascript
  return (
    <Grid container spacing={3}>
      {popularMovies.map((movie) => (
        <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3} key={movie.id}>
          <Card>{/* ... card contents ... */}</Card>
        </Grid>
      ))}
    </Grid>
  );
  ```
- Two movie cards are rendered, one for each movie returned by the API.

9. Completion:

- The component is now displaying the two movies, and the `status` in Redux is 'succeeded'.
- If the user navigates away and comes back, the `useEffect` hook won't dispatch a new action because the status is no longer 'idle'.

This process demonstrates how React hooks (`useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`) work in tandem with Redux to manage state, handle asynchronous operations, and keep the UI in sync with the data state. The component efficiently re-renders only when necessary, showing appropriate loading states and finally the desired content.

Certainly! I'll create a text diagram to illustrate the flow of data and state changes in this React-Redux application. Let's follow the process step-by-step:

```

Explanation:

1. MovieList component mounts and subscribes to the movies state in Redux.
2. Initial render shows an empty list as the initial state has no movies.
3. useEffect dispatches a FETCH_MOVIES action.
4. Redux receives the action and the thunk middleware initiates an API call.
5. The API processes the request and sends back the response with two movies.
6. Redux receives the response and dispatches a MOVIES_LOADED action with the movie data.
7. The reducer processes this action, updating the state with the two movies and changing the status to 'succeeded'.
8. Redux notifies subscribers (our MovieList component) of the state change.
9. The MovieList component detects the state change via useSelector.
10. The component re-renders, now displaying the two movies (Inception and The Matrix).
11. The DOM is updated to show these two movies to the user.

This process demonstrates how the component, Redux, and the API work in parallel:

- The component can render initially and wait for data without blocking.
- Redux manages the state and handles the asynchronous API call.
- The API processes the request independently.
- Once data is received, it flows through Redux to the component, triggering a re-render with the new movie data.

App Component (src/App.js):
Wraps everything with Redux Provider and renders MovieList
```

File Breakdown:

1. `src/components/MovieList.js`: Contains the MovieList component, useEffect hook, and rendering logic.
2. `src/store/store.js`: Configures the Redux store.
3. `src/store/moviesSlice.js`: Defines the movies slice with initial state, reducers, and async thunk.
4. `src/services/tmdbApi.js`: Contains the API call function to fetch movies.
5. `src/App.js`: The main App component that provides the Redux store and renders MovieList.

This diagram now shows where each part of the code is defined, making it easier to understand the file structure and responsibilities in the application.
